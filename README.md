# my-documented-app

## What it is

This is example documentation for a Vuejs app.

It was created by using:

* [JSDoc](https://devdocs.io/jsdoc/)
* [better-docs](https://github.com/SoftwareBrothers/better-docs)

The goal of it is to show you, dear programmer, what is possible when you work with jsdoc.

You can simply apply the same rules to the React application.

The code for this example can be found here: [SoftwareBrothers/example-design-system](https://github.com/SoftwareBrothers/example-design-system)

## What it contains

### Components

There are 2 components documented:

* {@link ProgressBar}
* {@link Box}

On their pages you can see:

* programming interface with props, methods, events and slots
* preview with the option to modify example codes in the browser.

### Tutorials

There are a couple of tutorials on the sidebar. Both {@tutorial colors} and {@tutorial brand} are filed with some example content. Rest is empty.

### Client library

Also, there is an example client library: {@link RESTClient} documented.

You can verify there how to:

* document methods with properties and return values
* document custom types
